# What is a graph?

After the success of Wordle, I was inspired to create my own daily guessing game with a geography twist. Thus, flagle.io was born!

## The Concept

The idea was simple: show players a flag, and they have to guess which country it belongs to. Like Wordle, there would be:
- One puzzle per day
- Limited attempts
- A way to share results without spoilers

## Technical Implementation

### React Architecture

I built flagle.io using React with a simple but effective architecture:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [currentGuess, setCurrentGuess] = useState('');
  const [guesses, setGuesses] = useState([]);
  const [gameState, setGameState] = useState('playing');
  
  // Game logic here
  
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Flag country={todaysFlag} />
      <GuessInput onSubmit={handleGuess} />
      <GuessHistory guesses={guesses} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Data Management

The biggest challenge was managing the country data:
- Flag images for all countries
- Country name variations (official vs common names)
- Handling different spellings and languages

### Daily Puzzle Logic

Each day's puzzle is determined by a simple algorithm:
```javascript
const getDailyFlag = () => {
  const today = new Date();
  const daysSinceEpoch = Math.floor(today.getTime() / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  const index = daysSinceEpoch % countries.length;
  return countries[index];
};
```

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Flag Recognition Difficulty

Some flags are incredibly similar (looking at you, Monaco and Indonesia!). I had to carefully curate the flag list to ensure fair gameplay.

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness

Making sure the game worked well on all devices was crucial, since many users play on their phones.

### 3. Performance

Loading hundreds of flag images efficiently required implementing lazy loading and image optimization.

## Results

The game quickly gained traction and now has thousands of daily players. It's been amazing to see people sharing their results and discussing geography!

## Lessons Learned

- Simple concepts often work best
- User experience is everything
- The geography community is incredibly passionate
- Daily games create strong user habits

Building flagle.io was an incredible experience that taught me a lot about web development, user experience, and the power of simple, engaging concepts.
